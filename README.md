# Power Siero Website built with Astro and Cosmic

To build this app, weâ€™re going to use the following technologies:

- [Astro](https://astro.build/) - A React framework for production that makes it easy to spin up a full-stack application.
- [Cosmic](https://www.cosmicjs.com/) - A Headless CMS enables the independence of the data (content) layer and gives us the ability to quickly manage template content.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A performant utility-first CSS framework that can be composed directly in your markup.
